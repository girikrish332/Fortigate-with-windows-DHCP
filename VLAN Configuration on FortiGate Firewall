Validating VLAN Configuration on FortiGate Firewall

Step 1: Accessing the FortiGate Interface

    Log in to the FortiGate's Command Line Interface (CLI) or web interface using your login credentials.

Step 2: Verifying VLAN Configuration

    If you're using the CLI, type show system interface to see all configured interfaces, including VLAN interfaces.
    Alternatively, in the web interface, navigate to Network > Interfaces to view interface configuration.

Step 3: Verifying VLAN Interfaces

    Check if there are VLAN interfaces for each VLAN configured on the Cisco switch.
    Make sure the VLAN interfaces have the correct VLAN IDs assigned and are active.

Step 4: Verifying VLAN Tagging

    If the FortiGate connects to the Cisco switch via a trunk port, ensure VLAN tagging (802.1Q) is enabled on FortiGate interfaces.
    Double-check the trunk interface configuration to confirm the allowed/tagged VLANs for communication with the switch.

Step 5: Checking VLAN Membership

    Review VLAN membership settings to ensure they're configured correctly for firewall policies, routing, and other network services.
    Verify that VLANs are associated with the appropriate firewall policies and routing configurations.
